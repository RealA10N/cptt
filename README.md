**The Competitive Programming Testing Tool** (*cptt* for short, not to be
confused with the [Competitive Programming Tool Kit]), is a Python package and
CLI that can execute programs and enforce certain behavior such as time and
memory constrains, output format and validation, etc.

Although *cptt* is a standalone project, it is the core testing framework behind
the [Competitive Programming Tool Kit].
